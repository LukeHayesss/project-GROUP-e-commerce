Ideas:

    Landing page

    Login + signup 
        signup: name and email
        
        login: email
        {
            email
        }

    Shop page
        nav bar
        categories
        searchable by body_location
        
    Product page
        Price
        Sold out or not
        add to cart
    (refer back to react ecosystem)
        
    
    Cart
        adding/removing from cart should be stored in a state (maybe use local storage)
        confirmation
        Customer info (name, email, credit card, address)
    Checkout
    
    
    Front end needs to give backend purchase data
    Structure of purchase data
    Order {
        Name,
        email
        creditcard
        address
        Postal code
        cart: [{itemId, numBought}]      
    }

DATA provided:
    Product:
    {
        name,
        price,
        body_location: wrist, hands, waist, chest, arms, head
        category: Fitness, entertainment, lifestyle, medical
        _id,
        imageSrc,
        numInStock,
        companyId
    }
    
    company/manufacturer
    {
        name:
        url:
        country:
        _id:
    }
    
    customer account:
    {
        name:
        email:
        _id
    }

Layout:
    Header: sticky?
    Footer: contact info/ other basics

    
Backend stuff:
    Endpoints in index.js in server folder
    Need to create a database for purchases
    Customer database
    Backend gets order request, responds with the same data but with ID appended
    
    create object when spinning up server that holds the data, and then work with that object
    migrate DB onto mongo AFTER everything works
    
    endpoints:
        get all products
        get product,(by id)
        get all companies
        get manufacturer/company (by id)
        
        post add a new order
        get existing order (by id)
        
        post new account (this would be called for signing up) create customer object in db and respond with success
        post existing account (would be called for logging in) respond with confirmation that account exists?
